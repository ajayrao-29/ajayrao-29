## Hi, I'm a Java Backend Developer 👋

I design and build backend systems using Java with a strong focus on
clean architecture, APIs, databases, and security best practices.

### 🔧 Tech Focus
- Java, Spring Boot, REST APIs
- MySQL, PostgreSQL
- Authentication & Authorization (JWT, Sessions)
- Secure File Handling & Data Protection
- Basic Cybersecurity concepts for backend systems

### 🛡 Security Awareness
- Password hashing & secure authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Common vulnerabilities (SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF)
- Encryption basics (AES, hashing)

### 📌 What You'll Find Here
- Backend projects built with Java & Spring Boot
- Secure REST APIs
- Practical implementations of authentication & authorization
- Backend-focused security experiments

📫 Open to backend developer opportunities and learning collaborations
